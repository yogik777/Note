1. Authorization Filters
    Run first and are used to enforce authentication and authorization policies.
    Examples: AuthorizeFilter
    Purpose: Ensures the user is authorized to access a resource.

2. Resource Filters
    Run after authorization and before model binding.
    Useful for caching or short-circuiting requests early in the pipeline.
    IResourceFilter
    public void OnResourceExecuting(ResourceExecutingContext context)
    public void OnResourceExecuted(ResourceExecutedContext context)

3. Action Filters
    Run before and after an action method executes.
    Can manipulate the action's inputs and outputs.
    IActionFilter
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)

4. Exception Filters
    Run when an unhandled exception occurs.
    Used for global error handling or logging.
    IExceptionFilter
    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)

5. Result Filters
    Run before and after the action result is executed.
    Useful for modifying or logging results.
    IResultFilter
    public void OnResultExecuting(ResultExecutingContext context)
    public void OnResultExecuted(ResultExecutedContext context)


You can register filters at:
1. Global Level (applies to all controllers/actions):
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllersWithViews(options =>
    {
        options.Filters.Add(new ActionFilterExample());
    });
}

2. Controller Level (applies to all actions in a controller):
[ServiceFilter(typeof(ActionFilterExample))]
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }
}

3.Action Level (applies to a specific action):
[ServiceFilter(typeof(ActionFilterExample))]
public IActionResult About()
{
    return View();
}

Custom Filter Attributes
-You can create a custom filter by implementing the appropriate filter interface or inheriting from Attribute.
public class CustomActionFilterAttribute : Attribute, IActionFilter
{
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        // Logic before action execution
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        // Logic after action execution
    }
}

Usage:
[CustomActionFilter]
public IActionResult MyAction()
{
    return View();
}



Filters [vs] Middleware 
-----------------------
Middleware
----------
-Middleware pipeline is a superset of Filter pipeline, which contains the full-set of all middlewares 
	added to the ApplicationBuilder in the application's startup code (Program.cs).

-Middleware pipeline execute for all requests. 

-Middleware handles application-level functionality such as Logging, HTTPS redirection, Performance 
	profiling, Exception handling, Static files, Authentication etc. by accessing low-level abstractions
	such as HttpContext


Filter 
------
-Filter pipeline is a subset of Middleware pipeline which executes under "EndPoint Middleware".

-In addition, filter pipeline executes for requests that reach "EndPoint Middleware".

-Filters handle MVC-specific functionlity such as manipulating or accessing ViewData, ViewBag,
	ModelState, Action result, Action parameters etc.
