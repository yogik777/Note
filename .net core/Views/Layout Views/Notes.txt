Layout Views 
------------
    Layout View is a web page (.cshtml) that is responsible for containing presentation 
logic template (commonly the html template with header, sidebar, footer etc.)

-The @RenderBody() method presents only in layout view to represent the place where 
    exactly the content from te view has to be rendered 
-The "Layout" property of the view specifies path of the layout view. 
    It can be dynamically sent in the view 
-Both View and Layout View shares the same ViewData object.
    So it is possible to send data from view to layout, since the view executes first.
-The css files / js files imported in layout view will be applicable to view also, 
    because the content of view will be merged into the layout view at run time.
