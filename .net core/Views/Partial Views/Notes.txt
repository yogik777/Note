Partial Views 
=============
-Partial view is a razor markup file (.chtml) that can't be invoked individually from 
    the controller; but can be invoked from any view within the same web application.


        View                        will invoke         Partial View
<partial name="partial view name">  =============>  Partial view content here 
                                <=====================
                               return the rendered html

Invoking Partial Views 
----------------------
<partial name="partial view name"/>
-Returns the content to the parent view. 

@await Html.PartialAsync("partial view name")
-Returns the content to the parent view.

@{ await Html.RenderPartialAsync("partial view name"); }
-Streams the content to the browser.
-should be invoked in a code block
-but instead of returning the content of the partial view to the parent view 
    it streams content directly to the browser. 
-so it improves the performance 
-so for performance in large scale code the RenderPartialAsync() is recommended 

-first two methods has a return value which you can use 
-but the third method return void because it directly sends response to the browser 


_ViewImports.cshtml
@addTagHelper "*, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers"

_ListPartialView.cshtml
<div class="list-container">
    <h3>Cities</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>London</li>
        <li>Paris</li>
        <li>New York</li>
        <li>Tokyo</li>
        <li>Rome</li>

<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
    the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
    versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<partial name="_ListPartialView"/>
@await Html.PartialAsync("_ListPartialView")
@{
    await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_ListPartialView");
}

-you can invoke partial view in same view as many number of times you want.




Partial Views with ViewData 
===========================
-When partial view is invoked, it receives a copy of the parent view's ViewData object.
-So, any changes made in the ViewData in the partial view, do NOT effect the ViewData of 
    the parent view.
-Optionally, you can supply a custom ViewData object to the partial view, if you don't 
    want the partial view to access the entire ViewData of the parent view.

                                                    copy
(Controller(Action(ViewData))) --> (View(ViewData)) ----> (Partial View(ViewData))

Invoking Partial Views with View Data 
-------------------------------------
@{ await Html.RenderPartialAsync("partial view name", ViewData); }

<partial name="partial view name" view-data="ViewData" />

Index.cshtml
<h1>Home</h1>
@{
    var myViewData = new ViewDataDictionary(ViewData);
    myViewData["ListTitle"] = "Countries";
    myViewData["ListItems"] = new List<string>
            {
                "India",
                "USA",
                "Canada",
                "Japan",
                "Germany"
            };
}
<partial name="_ListPartialView" view-data="myViewData"></partial>


_ListPartialView.cshtml
<div class="list-container">
    <h3>@ViewBag.ListTitle</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        @foreach(string item in ViewBag.ListItems)
        {
            <li>@item</li>
        }
    </ul>
</div>



Strongly Typed Partial Views 
============================
-Strongly typed Partial View is a partial view that is bound to a specified model 
    class. 
-So, it gets all the benefits of a strongly typed view.

                             @Model ModelClassName
Partial View        =======================================> Model 
Presentation logic & 
                                                            Data Properties
@Model.PropertyName



PartialViewResult 
=================
-PartialViewResult can represent the content of a partial. 
-Generally useful to fetch partial view's content into the browser, by making an 
    asynchronous request (XMLHttpRequest / fetch request) from the browser. 

asynchronous request    -------> 
                                                    return PartialResult 
response body (content of partial view) <-----
