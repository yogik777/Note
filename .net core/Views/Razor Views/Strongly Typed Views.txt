Strongly Typed View is a view that is bound to a specified model class.
It is mainly used to access the model object / model collection easily
    in the view.


            @model ModelClassName
    View    --------------------->   Model

Presentation Logic &            Data Properties
@Model.PropertyName


you can access model by using predefined property called Model
you have to mention type of the model in the view
    eg. @model IEnumerable<Person> 
-it is advisable to mention the model class in the @model directive


Benefits of Strongly Typed Views
----------------------------------

-> You will get Intellisense while accessing model Properties
    in strongly typed views, since the type of model class was mentioned 
    at @model directive.

-> Property names are compile-time checked; and shown as errors in case of 
    misspelled / non-existing properties in strongly typed views.

-> You will have only one model per one view in strongly typed views.

-> Easy to identify which model is being accessed in the view.


Helper method in Controller to invoke a View 
----------------------------------------------

return View(); //View name is the same name as the current action method.

return View(object Model); // View name is the same name as the current 
    action method & the view can be a strongly-typed view to receive the 
    supplied model object

return View(string ViewName); //View name is explicitly specified.

return View(string ViewName, object Model); //View name is explicitly   
    specified & the view can be a strongly-typed view to receive the 
    supplied model object.



-> Strongly typed view can be bound to only single model class
