Views
======

-> View is a web page. (.cshtml) that is responsible for containing presentation 
	logic that merges data along with static design code (HTML).

1. Controller creates object of View Model and fills data in its properties

2. Controller selects an appropriate view and invokes the same View & supplies
	object of View Model to the View.

3. View accesses the View Model.




	public class HomeController: Controller
	{
		[Route("home")]
		public IActionResult Index()
		{
			return View();  //Views/Home/Index.cshtml
							//return new ViewResult() { ViewName = "abc" };
							//return View("abc");		//abc.cshtml
		}
	}
