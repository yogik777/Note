-> Strongly Typed View can be bound to a single model directly.
    But that model class can have reference to objects of other 
    model classes.

              @model ModelClassName 
        View ------------------------> Model

Presentation Logic &

 @Model.Property1               public Model1 Property1 {get; set;}
 @Model.Property2               public Model2 Property2 {get; set;}
