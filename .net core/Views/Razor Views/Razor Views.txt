MVC Architecture Pattern
========================

"Model-View-Controller" (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates application code into 
	three main components: Models, Views and Controllers.


Controller 	-->Model
		-->View

View		-->Model


									Controller	1	Business Model
											->	Business Logic

											2	View Model
HttpRequest ->	Routing -> 	Model Binding	-> 	Action	->	Properties
					and								^ 4
					Model Validation				3		| View
											->	Presentation Logic

1. Controller invokes Business Model.
2. Controller creates object of View Model.
3. Controller invokes View.
4. View accesses View Model.


=> Responsibilities of Model-View-Controller
Controller -> 
==========		- Receives HTTP request data.
			- Invoke business model to execute business logic.

Business Model ->
==============	- Receives input data from the controller.
			- Performs business operations such as retrieving / inserting data from database
			- Sends data of the database, back to the controller.

Controller ->
==========		- Creates object of ViewModel and fills data into its properties.
			- Selects a View & invoke it & also pass the object of ViewModel to the view.

View ->
====			-Receives the object of ViewModel from the controller.
			-Accesses properties of View Model to render data in html code.
			-After the view renders, the rendered view result will be sent as response.


Benefits / Goals of MVC architectural pattern
=============================================
Clean separation
of
Concerns ->	
	-Each component(model, view and controller)  performs single responsibility.
	-Identifying and fixing errors will be easy.
	-Each component(model, view and controller) can be developed independently.
	-In practical, both view and controller depend on the model.
		Model doesn't depend on neither view nor the controller.
		This is one of the key benefits of the 'clean separation'.
		This separation allows the model to be built and tested independently.
	-Unit testing each individual component is easier.
