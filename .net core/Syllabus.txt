SOLID Principles 
	1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
		-A class should have only one reason to change.
	2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
		-A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
		-Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
	4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
		-A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
	5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
		-High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. 
			Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
	Principle		Focus												Benefits
	SRP				Single responsibility per class						Simplified maintenance and testing.
	OCP				Extend without modifying existing code				Easier to add features without breaking code.
	LSP				Subtypes should behave like their base type			Ensures consistent behavior.
	ISP				Specific interfaces for specific needs				Prevents unused code and unnecessary coupling.
	DIP				Depend on abstractions, not implementations			Enables flexibility and testability.

	-Custom Middleware
		-Implement IMiddleware: This interface requires a single method: InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next). 
			This is the heart of your middleware's logic.
	-Custom Conventional Middleware
		-Class-Based: Conventional middleware is implemented as a class.
		-Constructor Injection: It receives dependencies (if any) through its constructor.
		-Invoke Method: This is the heart of the middleware, containing the logic that handles each request.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
	-CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browser 
		to allow or deny a web page from making requests to a different domain than the 
		one that served the web page.
	1.Configure CORS 
		builder.Services.AddCors(options => {
			options.AddDefaultPolicy(builder => {
				builder.WithOrigins("http://localhost:4200");
			});
		});
	2.Use CORS 
		app.UseRouting();
		app.UseCors();

	CORS Configuration 
		"AllowedOrigins" : 
		[
			"http://localhost:4200"
		]
		builder.Services.AddCors(options => {
			options.AddDefaultPolicy(policyBuilder => {
				policyBuilder.WithOrigins(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AllowedOrigins").Get<string[]>[]);
			});
		});

	Default CORS Policy 
		-Authorization Token is by default not allowed.
		builder.Services.AddCors(options => {
			options.AddDefaultPolicy(policyBuilder => {
				policyBuilder.WithOrigins(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AllowedOrigins").Get<string[]>[]);
				policyBuilder.WithHeaders("Authorization", "origin", "accept", "content-types");
			});
		})

		Preflight Request 
		-----------------
			-It is an HTTP OPTIONS request that is sent by the browser to the Web API server before the 
				actual request is made. 
			-The preflight request is used to determine whether the Web API server is willing to accept 
				the actual request 
			-when you try tor customize the headers the browser sends this request
