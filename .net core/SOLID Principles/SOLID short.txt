SOLID Principles 
================
"SOLID" is a set of five design patterns, whose main focus is to create loosely coupled,
flexible, maintainable code. 

-Broad goal of SOLID Principle: Reduce dependencies of various class / modules of the application

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    -> A software module or class should have one-and-only reason to change
    -> i.e one class should do only one task it should not involve in multiple tasks 


Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
    -> A class is closed for modification: but open for extension.
    -> instead of making changes to the existing code base it is advisable to implement 
        the same as a separate class. you may reuse the code via inheritance or through 
        interfaces 
    -> you should not make changes into the existing code base unless you want to 
        fix the bugs 


Liskov Substitution principle (LSP)
    -> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. 
    -> subtypes should not override any existing methods of the base class in case they 
        override the existing functionalty of the base class should not be changed 
        the method signature the return value and the exceptions should be exactly matched 
        with the same base type 

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    -> No client class should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
    -> instead of creating a large interface with multiple methods, create same 
        as smaller and simple interfaces. i.e. create one interface of one 
        specific functionality 

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    -> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend 
        upon abstractions.
