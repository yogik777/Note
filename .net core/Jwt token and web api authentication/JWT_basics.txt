JWT - Basics 
============

What is JWT 
    A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact and self-contained object for 
    securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.



User            1)User Sign-In (using user ID/Password)     Authentication Server 
                -------------------------------------->

                <--------------------------------------
                            (JWT token)
                2)User Authenticated, JWT created and returned to the user 

                --------------------------------------->    API Server 
                            (JWT token)
                3)On subsequent requests, user sends JWT token in request header 
                <--------------------------------------
                4) Application verifies and processes the APi call 

Contents of JWT 
===============
 -Header (base 64 string) 
 -Payload (base 64 string)
 -Signature (base 64 string)

Header    -> Defines the type of token and the signing algorithm used 

Payload   -> Contains user claims (user details such as name, email or user type).
            Eg:{"userId":"flejrierie-rer-ree-rere"}

Signature -> It is used to verify that the message wasn't changed along 
             the way.
             It is usually signed by using a secrete key (HMAC algorithm).


base 64 => it's a form of data which is used to encode the binary data in a printable 
            text format. behind every base64 string there is a normal data 
            either it is a plain text or a json object that is converted into a base 64
            string by using an algorithm. it is not a secured algorithm(not for 
            security)

Inputs required to generate JWT token

    header
        {
            "type":"JWT",
            "alg":"HS256"
        }
    payload 
        {
            "userId":"b08f86af-35da-feree"
        }
    secret 
        MySecret 

    algorithm --> 
    data = base64Encode(header)+ "." + base64Encode( payload )

    signature = base64encode( hashedData )

    hashedData = hash(data, secret)

    jwtToken = data + "." + signature 


Example token:
feier98ufjiejoirejoj. |  rieorjeorj38fjjeorjeijoej. | -xjorejroe_eiorjeirjeojre.



-the algorithm and other things will be taken care by a nuget package so we need 
    to pass essential inputs header, payload, secret and essential values

-the jwt token is the secured way to represent the user details but how do you 
    insure that this token is generated by the perticular server it is because 
    -the hash is generated based on the secrete value by using a secured hashing 
        algorithm 
    -so if any malacious user is trying to mimic the process he do not know the 
     actual value of the secrete which is know to the same server which is 
     generally stored in the environment variables of the particular server 

    -so on the production senarios that secrete value is not even known to the 
        developers 
    -at development time developers can use some dummy secrete values 
     but the actual secrete value on the production server will be different 
    -the production level secrete value will be stored on the production server 
        as environment variable. 
    -so in that way the server can easily identify whether this token is generated 
        by same token or by somebody else 
        in case a server has received a token if that token is not generated by 
        the same server. it can't be reproduced by the same server. because the 
        secretes does'nt match. thats why the jwt is secured 
    -the client/browser does'nt verify any thing to the security, it simply 
        receives the token stores it on the browser memory and sends the same
        token as the part of the request header to the server 
    -how does the server verifies if the token is valid or not? ->
        it repeats same process based on header and payload. ant it gets the new token 
        if the newly generated token and the token which was supplied by the client 
        as the part of the request header matches then it is valid in case they 
        do not match it is treated as invalid token.
