Clean Architecture
==================
    Instead of "business logic" depend on "data access logic", this dependency is inverted;
that means, the "data access logic" depend on "business logic".

Benefit: The business logic is highly clean-separated, independent of data storage and UI,
            unit-testable 

-clean Architecture is most popular and recomanded to use by most architects 
-so what is difference between regular 3 tire or 4 tire architecture and clean architecture 

Benefits 
--------
Changing external system
    Allows you to change external systems (external APIs / third party services) easily,
    without affecting the application core. 

database independent 
    The application core doesn't depend on specific databases; so you can change it any 
    time, without affecting the application core.

Scalable 
    You can easily scale-up or scale-out, without really affecting overall architecture of 
    the application. 


Testable 
    The application core doesn't depend on any other external APIs or repositories; so 
that you can write unit tests against business logic services easily by mocking essential 
repositories.


-Clean architecture is earlier named as "Hexagonal architecture", "Onion architecture",
    "Domain-Driven Design", Vertical Slice Architecture". Over time, it is popular 
    as "clean architecture".
